# Text-RPG-Game-REFRESH
This is my old idea for game, but with new options.
I'm working on a story, but I have solutions for logic and system for now.
This is text RPG game where you can create a character. 
There are three options for character race: WARRIOR, NECROMANCER and ELF.
Your hero has owns special attacks, weapons and armors, 
also you have stat points - charisma, strength, agility, magic energy.
Stats affect the game turn.
The fight with enemy will be turn-based. 
The whole game will be screen in console window - also you have to
enter all game-commands in the console.

WORK IN PROGRESS
